- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
This program draws shapes that react to audio.

# Instructions
The program requires user input.
Functions:
Press the '0' key to start/restart the music
Press the '1' key to toggle between cube and twocube
Press the '2' key to toggle between cube and sphere
Press the '3' key to toggle between cube and medley
Press '9' to stop the music

# How it works
The shapes are synchronised with the audio signals using the getAmplitude() function so they widen 
and/or move across the screen depending on how loud or quiet the music is at that point in time.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I'm proud that I was able to use the skills I learned in class to create something beautiful.
This program was inspired my granddad who is a huge Isaac Hayes fan and introduced me to his music
which I fell in love with instantly. 
Being able to combine Isaac Hayes and programming is very satisfying to me.
